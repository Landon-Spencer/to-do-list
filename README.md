# To-Do List Application
This application allows the user to type in items that they want to add to their to-do list and create a list of those items. Each item can be checked off/crossed out and remain in the to-do list. Once the user is completly done with an item they can move that item to the completed list by clicking that item button. Completed items are then moved to the completed list.
